1. Introduction
For many years, molecular biologists have sought ways 
to use cellular repair mechanisms to manipulate DNA 
through genome editing. In this way, they would have the 
power to change the genome by correcting a mutation or 
introducing a new function (Rodriguez, 2016). For this 
purpose, genome editing technologies were developed 
(Memi et al., 2018). In recent years, clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats technology 
(CRISPR-Cas9) has become the most preferred method of 
gene editing. This technology has advantages such as high 
accuracy, easy handling, and relatively low cost compared to 
previous technologies, such as zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) 
and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN). 
Thanks to these benefits, CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be 
easily applied in any molecular biology laboratory. 

Genome editing technologies are used in the formation 
of human disease models in experimental animals and for 
the understanding of basic gene functions. They also have 
great therapeutic potential for future treatment of untreated 
diseases such as certain cancers, genetic disorders, and 

HIV/AIDS. Today, genome editing in somatic cells is one 
of the promising areas of therapeutic development (Otieno, 
2015). However, various bioethical issues have arisen due 
to the potential impact of these technologies on the safety 
of food stocks and clinical applications (Hundleby and 
Harwood, 2018; Hirch et al., 2019). This review discusses 
the challenges, possible consequences, and bioethical 
issues of CRISPR-Cas9 in detail.

2. Biology and function of CRISPR-Cas9 technology
Genome editing technologies often work by creating 
fractures in chromosomal DNA. ZFN, TALEN, and 
CRISPR-Cas9 are all based solely on nucleases (Kim 
and Kim, 2014; Roh et al., 2018). The strength of these 
technologies stems from the ability to create fractures in the 
desired region of a specific target sequence as determined 
by the researcher. This allows researchers to modify the 
genome in practice in any region (Memi et al., 2018).

The creation of changes in the genome depends mainly 
on the DNA repair capacity of the cells (Lau et al., 2018). 
All cells have two basic mechanisms for the repair of double 

Abstract: Genome editing technologies have led to fundamental changes in genetic science. Among them, CRISPR-Cas9 technology 
particularly stands out due to its advantages such as easy handling, high accuracy, and low cost. It has made a quick introduction in 
fields related to humans, animals, and the environment, while raising difficult questions, applications, concerns, and bioethical issues 
to be discussed. Most concerns stem from the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to genetically alter human germline cells and embryos (called 
germline genome editing). Germline genome editing leads to serial bioethical issues, such as the occurrence of undesirable changes 
in the genome, from whom and how informed consent is obtained, and the breeding of the human species (eugenics). However, the 
bioethical issues that CRISPR-Cas9 technology could cause in the environment, agriculture and livestock should also not be forgotten. 
In order for CRISPR-Cas9 to be used safely in all areas and to solve potential issues, worldwide legislation should be prepared, taking 
into account the opinions of both life and social scientists, policy makers, and all other stakeholders of the sectors, and CRISPR-Cas9 
applications should be implemented according to such legislations. However, these controls should not restrict scientific freedom. Here, 
various applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, especially in medicine and agriculture, are described and ethical issues related to 
genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology are discussed. The social and bioethical concerns in relation to human beings, other 
organisms, and the environment are addressed.

chain breaks on DNA. One of them is nonhomologous 
end joining (NHEJ) and the other is the homologous 
dependent repair (HDR) mechanism. In NHEJ, the ends of 
the fractures are quickly connected directly to each other, 
regardless of the sequence homology, while HDR requires 
homology to repair the damaged DNA site. In order to 
achieve homology, the undamaged sister chromatid is 
used as a template and DNA damage is repaired (Urnov, 
2018).

CRISPR-Cas9 is a naturally occurring defense system in 
prokaryotic organisms that provides resistance to foreign 
genetic elements such as plasmids and bacteriophages 
(Barrangau et al., 2007; Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008). 
When the virus or plasmid enters a bacterial cell, CRISPR-
Cas9 allows the addition of short viral DNA molecules 
to the CRISPR site. CRISPR sequences (CRISPRs) are 
short DNA repeats of viral or plasmid origin found in the 
genomes of bacteria and are defined as clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats. Cas genes (CRISPR-
related) are genes that encode nuclease or helicase proteins 
associated with CRISPR repeat sequences that have the 
function of cutting or dissolving DNA (Jansen et al., 2002). 
Cas9, a member of the Cas gene family, was isolated from 
Streptococcus pyogenes and is an endonuclease capable of 
cutting DNA from two active cut regions at both ends of 
the DNA double helix (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014; 
Rodriguez, 2016). The CRISPR-Cas system recognizes the 
DNA of the invading virus or bacterium and directs the 
Cas protein to destroy foreign DNA (Otieno, 2015).

In the following years, it was discovered that the 
CRISPR-Cas system can be programmed to find and cut 
specific target DNA regions, thereby providing genome 
editing (Jinek et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2013). As a result of 
understanding that the human genome can be edited by 
CRISPR-Cas9, it became clear that genome editing could 
also be used for therapeutic purposes, and a new era in 
genetic engineering began (Lau et al., 2018; Roh et al., 
2018). 

3. Application areas
3.1. Animal models 
CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to create animal models 
to mimic human diseases and to understand disease 
development by mutating or silencing genes. A mouse 
model has been developed to determine the harmful 
effects of mutations in cancer by making mutations that 
cause the loss of function in tumor suppressor genes or 
give functions to protooncogenes (Chin, 2015).

Conventional genetically modified (GM) mouse 
models are produced by gene targeting in embryonic 
stem cells or transgenesis, which are time-consuming 
and highly expensive. With CRISPR-Cas9, GM mice can 
be efficiently produced in a much shorter time (Mei et 

al., 2016). It can be applied to nonhuman primates such 
as monkeys. Nonhuman primates are more similar to 
humans in anatomical, physiological, and genetic terms 
than rodents (Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, they are more 
suitable models than rodents in understanding human 
biology and disease development (Xin et al., 2016). The 
first successful application of CRISPR-Cas9 in nonhuman 
primates, from which a knockout monkey was produced, 
was realized in 2014 (Niu et al., 2014). However, genome 
sequences of many nonhuman primates are not yet fully 
identified. This makes it difficult to design selected single-
guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (Gou and Li, 2015; Lou et al., 2016). 
Therefore, the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in nonhuman 
primates is still at an early stage.
3.2. Genome editing in specific tissues
Researchers have been able to modify the genomes of 
specific tissues such as liver and brain tissues using 
hydrodynamic injection and adeno-associated virus 
(AAV) (Rodriguez et al., 2014; Senis et al., 2014). In a 
study, CRISPR-Cas9 has been successfully and effectively 
applied to the mammalian nervous system. A mixture 
of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled AAV-spCas9 
and AAV-spGuide plasmids was transferred in vivo to 
the hippocampal toothed brain folds of adult male mice 
(Swiech et al., 2015). It is thought that the number of 
such applications will grow in the fields of cancer and 
neuroscience in the following years (Mei et al., 2016).
3.3. Multiple gene mutations
CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to generate mutants for target 
genes. In the first such study by Li et al., six sgRNAs 
targeting Cas9 mRNA and six different genomic regions 
encoding the Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 genes were transferred 
to the cytoplasm of rat embryos (Li et al., 2013). Findings 
showed that all three Tet genes carried the desired 
mutations in 59% of newborn rat pups. Successful results 
were also reported in studies with zebrafish embryos and 
Arabidopsis as well (Ota et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015).
3.4. Epigenome studies
Epigenome studies can be performed in two different ways: 
genome or epigenome editing (Chen et al., 2014; Huisman 
et al., 2015). In genome editing, nuclease is used to modify 
the DNA sequence, whereas in epigenome editing, an 
effector domain is used and the DNA sequence is not 
changed. This function is achieved by catalytic inactivation 
of the Cas9-associated effector domain by replacing 
the Cas9 protein. Altered effector proteins are used to 
activate or suppress transcription (Lau and Davie, 2016). 
In epigenome editing, the epigenome can be modified 
by changing the proteins that maintain and protect the 
epigenome. Suppression of DNA methylation as a result 
of degradation of catalytic domains that accelerate the loss 
of spherical DNA methylation in human cells and lead to

cell death is a good example of epigenome studies using 
CRISPR-Cas9 (Liao et al., 2015).

Another application is the editing of long nonencoded 
RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that can 
control gene expression and epigenome processes. In a 
study, eRNA-expression factors and IncRNA-expression 
enhancers were suppressed by stimulating deletion 
mutations in a lymphoma cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 
(Pefanis et al., 2015). It is predicted that CRISPR-Cas9 
may allow different levels of epigenome modification and 
facilitate further changes to humans (Liao et al., 2015; Mei 
et al., 2016).
3.5. Treatment of diseases
CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied to cells in vivo or ex vivo. In 
the in vivo approach, CRISPR-Cas9 is directly transferred 
to cells in the body using either viral or nonviral methods. 
In the ex vivo approach, first the cells are removed from 
the body; then CRISPR is applied to the cells and they 
are transferred back to the body (Roh et al., 2018). This 
approach has great potential to develop tissue-based 
therapies (Rath et al., 2015). Using CRISPR-Cas9, the 
mutation in the dystrophin protein responsible for the 
most common form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
was successfully removed (Amoasii et al., 2018; Duchêne 
et al., 2018; Koo et al., 2018; Long et al., 2018). There are 
studies to prevent and treat AIDS by inhibiting the entry 
of HIV into the cell or by removing the HIV genome 
integrated into the host genome using CRISPR-Cas9 
(Saayman et al., 2015). Induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs) were successfully produced from cystic fibrosis 
patients with confirmed F508 deletion in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene by CRISPR-Cas9 
(Firth et al., 2015). There are also studies for cataracts 
(Wu et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016) and Parkinson’s disease 
(Yang et al., 2016). However, recent studies have shown 
that CRISPR-Cas9 activates the type 1 interferon (INF) 
pathway, causing a type 1 INF-mediated immune response 
(Kim et al., 2018; Charleswort et al., 2019). These findings 
currently limit the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in treatment.
3.6. Industrial uses
CRISPR was first used for commercial purposes to make 
bacterial cultures used in cheese and yogurt production 
resistant to viral infections (van Erp et al., 2015). One of 
the applications in agriculture is to produce GM crops 
(Hundleby and Harwood, 2019). There are attempts to 
increase the yield in the livestock industry (van Erp et 
al., 2015). It can be used to control invasive pest species 
to reverse pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects 
and weeds or to prevent disease spread (Esvelt et al., 
2014). Researchers have succeeded in preventing the 
spread of genes protecting mosquitoes from harmful 
malaria parasites (Gantz et al., 2015) and making female 
mosquitoes infertile in the laboratory (Hammond et al., 

2016). Vaccine development is another significant area 
of interest. The smallpox virus vector (VACV) is used 
in the eradication and vaccination of smallpox. Using 
CRISPR-Cas9, the efficiency of marker-free VACV vectors 
has been increased (Yuan et al., 2015). Another example 
is the hepatitis B vaccine. In order to prevent viral gene 
expression and replication, specific regions of the hepatitis 
B genome were targeted and cut by CRISPR-Cas9 
(Ramanan et al., 2015).
3.7. RNA editing
Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequences can also be 
edited by CRISPR-Cas9. In RNA editing, CRISPR-Cas9 
consists of a DNA oligonucleotide presenting the PAM 
(protospacer adjacent motif) region (PAMmer), ssRNA, 
guide RNA (gRNA), and Cas9 protein. PAMmer acts as 
a PAM region specifically recognized by Cas9 and directs 
Cas9 to bind and cut the target ssRNA. 5’-Elongated 
PAMmers containing bases paired with different ssRNAs 
and immediately in front of PAM are required for specific 
binding of target ssRNAs. Since RNA molecules have 
different functions than DNA, CRISPR-Cas9 can offer a 
much more flexible application than other genome editing 
methods (Mei et al., 2016).
3.8. Military applications
One of the lesser-discussed application areas of CRISPR-
Cas9 technology is its use for military purposes. As is 
known, a substantial portion of genome editing studies 
are supported by the defense ministries of the countries. 
These studies are commonly focused on increasing 
the tolerance of soldiers against biological or chemical 
warfare. This technology has the potential to influence 
human performance optimization (Greene and Master, 
2018). Studies are usually concentrated on discovering 
different genes that can be harnessed from other species 
(Gracheva et al., 2010) and identifying new genes that can 
be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, which is 
frequently experienced by soldiers (Cornelis et al., 2010). 
In a study by Zou et al. (2015), researchers developed dog 
embryos with higher muscle mass using CRISPR-Cas9. 
Another interesting study showed that the CMG2 gene, 
known to cause low sensitivity to anthrax toxin when 
expressed in small amounts, could be silenced by this 
technology (Arévalo et al., 2014). However, it should be 
noted that far more research needs to be conducted for 
using CRISPR technology in humans as a defense tool 
against biological and chemical weapons (Greene and 
Master, 2018).
3.9. DNA replacement in human embryos (germline 
genome therapy)
The most controversial usage of CRISPR-Cas9 is the 
modification of human embryo DNA, or, in other words, 
its use for germline genome therapy. In 2015, a group of 



AYANOĞLU et al. / Turk J Biol

Chinese researchers led by Junjiu Huang applied CRISPR-
Cas9 to remove a mutation that causes β-thalassemia, 
which is a fatal blood disease, from the human β-globulin 
(HBB) gene in the germline of human embryos. In this 
research, six abnormal embryos not suitable for in vitro 
fertilization were used. The mutation could be corrected 
in only one of the embryos. Although the mutation could 
be corrected in two other embryos, nontarget effects 
occurred in other genes. In the other three embryos, the 
mutation could not be corrected. It has been reported 
that this technique is not ready for clinical use because 
of nontarget effects on different genes (Roh et al., 2018; 
Carroll, 2019). Modifications that occur in germline cells 
can be transferred to future generations. Scientists think 
that they can extract genes that cause diseases in the 
population using CRISPR-Cas9 (Cai et al., 2018; Memi et 
al., 2018). 

4. Bioethical issues
The fact that CRISPR-Cas9 is among the important 
discoveries of the 21st century is widely accepted in the 
scientific community and related industries. However, 
the rapid rise of CRISPR-Cas9 has led to new bioethical, 
social, and legal issues in medicine, agriculture, livestock, 
and the environment. Possible risks and bioethical issues 
related to CRISPR-Cas9 are summarized in the Table. 
4.1. Ecological imbalance
In studies using RNA-targeted gene editing methods based 
on CRISPR-Cas9, nontarget effects should be examined in 

depth. Since gene drift will persist in a population, possible 
off-target mutations will continue in each generation. In 
addition, the number and effect of mutations may increase 
as generations progress (Rodriguez, 2016; Hundleby 
and Harwood, 2019). Another concern is the possibility 
that genes can be transferred to other species in the 
environment. Transferring the regulated sequences to 
other species may result in the transmission of negative 
characteristics to the associated organisms (Esvelt et al., 
2014). The distribution of the properties of the entrained 
genes among the populations can make control very 
difficult.
4.2. Regulations for consumers
The use of CRISPR-Cas9 to obtain the desired genetic 
modifications makes it very difficult to identify and regulate 
genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the market after 
they leave the laboratory. Therefore, regulatory agencies, 
such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
European Medicines Agency (EMA), and others, should 
consider whether any GMOs are suitable for consumers. 
However, it is not known exactly how to evaluate the 
possibilities of a growing market with CRISPR-Cas9 
(Ledford, 2015; Hundleby and Harwood, 2019).

One of the dilemmas of CRISPR-Cas9 that concerns 
all the humanity is patenting. As is known, transgenic 
organisms of industrial use and also some human gene 
sequences for clinical purposes have been patented 
(Rodriguez, 2016; Sherkow, 2018). As technologies such 
as CRISPR continue to evolve, patent-related issues in

many areas of biotechnology will continue to increase 
in the upcoming years. Even today, there are many such 
cases of patenting. The best-known case is the patent right 
case between Zhang and Doudna and Charpentier for the 
therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells. In the 
case concluded on 2 December 2016, it was decided to 
grant the patent to Caribou Biosciences, which Doudna 
was the founder of (Donohoue et al., 2018).
4.3. Genome editing for enhancement
The editing of human germline cells with CRISPR-Cas9, 
which will be discussed later in more detail, is prohibited 
for various safety reasons. However, the rate of application 
of CRISPR-Cas9 to somatic cells is gradually increasing 
in order to transfer the desired characteristics to our 
lives. Many phenotypic characteristics have a genetic 
component independent of the environment. By utilizing 
this feature, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to improve the 
performance of athletes, to prevent violent behavior, 
or to reduce dependence (Rodriguez, 2016). Although 
gene therapy is often used to treat patients for their own 
benefit, the criminal justice system may require repeater or 
dangerous offenders to correct the genes associated with 
violence by genome editing technologies in the future. 
One of the biggest dilemmas here is to obtain informed 
consent for an underage person if the intervention is 
made during the development of the zygote. This will give 
parents or guardians the right to make decisions on behalf 
of minors for nonhealth reasons. Furthermore, when 
socially assessed, some genetically improved populations 
or individuals may have some advantages in comparison 
to others in terms of various features such as mental and 
physical capacity (Brokowski, 2018). Therefore, the use of 
CRISPR-Cas9 in genome enhancement should be seriously 
discussed both socially and morally.
4.4. Military research
The use of CRISPR technology for military purposes is 
generally considered within the scope of nontherapeutic 
enhancement and is covered similarly. From this point of 
view, related bioethical issues are commonly discussed 
in terms of concepts of benefit/risk, informed consent, 
and accessibility (Greene and Master, 2018). A notable 
bioethical problem is the off-target mutations that have 
been mentioned in relation to other topics. Off-target 
mutations can cause many undesirable changes in the 
genome or even lead to fatal diseases. Current information 
obtained from studies on off-target mutations caused by 
CRISPR on the genome is very limited. Therefore, the 
benefit/risk relationship needs to be evaluated carefully. 
In addition, the possibility that this technology can be 
used for the production of new biological weapons is 
frightening.

Another ambiguous issue that needs to be discussed in 
military enhancement applications is informed consent. 

It could be difficult to obtain informed consent forms 
independently without any interaction among individuals 
due to military training methods, strict norms, and 
chains of command. Additionally, some soldiers may have 
difficulty in understanding the concepts of gene therapy 
and genome editing, as well as the potential risks and 
benefits of the applications (Greene and Master, 2018).

One important ethical issue is that the use of such 
technologies will support ongoing inequalities among 
military parties (Amoroso and Wenger, 2003). CRISPR 
is currently an expensive technology. Some developed 
countries might think of using this technology to further 
strengthen their defenses and even attack underdeveloped 
or developing countries. This situation could cause 
a constant tension, making it difficult to provide an 
environment of peace and stability worldwide.
4.5. Generation of chimeric animals for organ 
transplantation
Organ transplantation is the replacement of an organ that 
cannot function in an individual’s body with a healthy 
organ from a living donor or cadaver. The primary purpose 
is to save the life of the patient, who is in danger of organ 
failure, and to increase the lifespan and quality of life 
(Black et al., 2018). The development of chimeric animals 
may prevent patients from spending precious time waiting 
for an appropriate donor.

Bioethical issues in the generation of chimeric animals 
arise from the fact that chimeras contain human nerve and 
germ cells (Polcz and Lewis, 2016). The two main issues 
can be summarized as defining the order of nature and 
the moral disorders caused by how the organism is treated 
depending on whether the organism is accepted as  human 
or animal. Some people think that chimeric embryos will 
affect human dignity and identity because they have the 
power to develop organisms with human-derived cells and 
tissues. The others state that chimeric organisms containing 
human cells cannot turn into humans and therefore will 
not affect human dignity. They also argue that the human-
like features imparted to chimeras will neither affect the 
biological environment nor the moral status of animals 
and will never reach human consciousness (Koplin, 2019; 
Degrazia, 2019).
4.6. Animal welfare and dignity
Animal welfare is another bioethical concern encountered 
during the application of genome editing technologies on 
animals. First of all, the possibility of off-target mutations 
in the genome can lead to diseases or different side effects 
in animals (Ishii, 2017a; Schultz-Bergin, 2018; de Graeff 
et al., 2019). Such a situation will adversely affect animal 
welfare (Rodriguez, 2017).

The second bioethical issue to be discussed could be the 
concerns about “animal dignity” (Eriksson et al., 2018) and 
alterations in their natural environments and physiological 



AYANOĞLU et al. / Turk J Biol

115

needs (Manesh et al., 2014). Some studies have stated that 
the use of animals as objects only serving for humans 
is not ethically or morally acceptable (Martinelli et al., 
2014; Fung and Kerridge, 2016; Greenfield, 2017), and 
such practices can lead to greater control over humans on 
animals (Ishii, 2017a; de Graeff et al., 2019). Some others 
think that animals are not bound by any moral law and 
therefore there is no need for a discussion regarding animal 
dignity (Heeger, 2015; Shriver and McConnachie, 2018). 
Schultz-Bergin (2017) stated that animal rights, welfare, 
and dignity will not be adversely affected since these 
animals will occur through genome editing technologies. 
The existence of contrary opinions on this matter indicates 
that the mentioned bioethical issues will be on the agenda 
for a long time.
4.7. CRISPR-Cas9 for human germline 
The potential for using CRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing 
in the human germline has raised serious ethical debates. 
Until 2015, all therapeutic applications in humans 
were performed in somatic cells using genome editing 
technologies. However, in 2015, the editing of the human 
germline performed by Chinese scientist Huang and 
his team with CRISPR-Cas9 raised new social, moral, 
and bioethical issues (Liang et al., 2015; Ormond et al., 
2017). Bioethical issues caused by genome editing in the 
germline can be classified into two main topics depending 
on the success and failure of genome editing technologies 
(Ormond et al., 2017; Greely, 2019).
4.7.1. Issues that may occur in the failure of germline 
genome editing
Some of the ethical dilemmas of genome editing in the 
germline arise from the fact that changes in the genome can 
be transferred to the next generations. Therapeutic genome 
editing in somatic cells generally does not cause significant 
concerns when assessing the risk/benefit balance and the 
use of informed consent. The application of CRISPR-Cas9 
in the germline is considered more problematic because 
of the risk of causing various mutations and side effects 
and transferring undesirable changes to future generations 
(Cyranoski and Reardon, 2015; Brokowski, 2018; Cai et al., 
2018; Halpern et al., 2019). In fact, Huang and his team 
found that nontarget mutations in the genome occurred 
and the study was terminated earlier than planned (Liang 
et al., 2015). Nontarget mutations are unintentional 
mutations in the genome and may have harmful effects 
on the organism as these mutations can lead to cell death 
or transformation (Zhang et al., 2014). Frighteningly, 
researchers have found that mutations caused by CRISPR-
Cas9 in embryos are much more common than in mouse 
or human adult cells (Cyranoski and Reardon, 2015). In a 
study performed with human embryos, it was stated that 
nontarget mutations occur only in the exon regions and 
therefore the number of mutations may be much higher 

than expected (Liang et al., 2015). Due to the high risk of 
nontarget mutations, some scientists argue that genome 
editing studies in germline cells should be terminated and 
its future should be discussed (Cyranoski and Reardon, 
2015). Some scientists state that newly developed CRISPR-
Cas9 could reduce or even prevent the number of nontarget 
mutations. In this method, the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 
was increased by using Cas9-regulated human iPSCs in 
region-specific gene targeting (Yumlu et al., 2019).

Another bioethical dilemma is the cost of germline 
genome editing. Genome editing is an expensive 
technology (Wilson and Carroll, 2019). While families 
in rich countries may have the power to cover this cost, 
families in developing countries may not. This situation 
may cause children born in developed countries to have an 
unfair advantage in terms of various characteristics such 
as intelligence and physical state compared to children in 
other countries (Otieno, 2015).

CRISPR-Cas9 is based on the use of nuclease enzymes. 
The nuclease enzymes used may not be as effective as 
desired and not be able to cut all copies of the target gene, 
or the cell may begin to divide before genome editing is 
completed. As a result, a condition called genetic mosaicism 
can occur (Lanphier et al., 2015). Genetic mosaicism is the 
presence of genetically different somatic cell populations 
in an organism and is often masked. Mosaicism can also 
lead to major phenotypic changes, the formation of fatal 
genetic mutations (Capalbo and Rienzi, 2017), and some 
genetic diseases such as Down, Klinefelter, and Turner 
Syndromes (Otieno, 2015). Therefore, the nuclease 
cleavage sites should be exactly confirmed and the 
possibility of mosaicism should be completely eliminated.

One of the important bioethical issues is side effects 
in embryos. It is pointed out that the possible side effects 
cannot be predicted before birth and the consequences 
are not clearly known (Otieno, 2015; Brokowski, 2018). 
Controls can only be performed in a small group of cells. 
This limitation causes the effects of genome editing on 
embryos to be unknown and unprevented until birth. 
In fact, it should be considered that it may take years for 
many potential problems to emerge (Lanphier et al., 2015; 
Halpern et al., 2019).
4.7.2. Issues that may occur in the successful application 
of germline genome editing
The first of the bioethical issues of successful germline 
genome editing is the use for nontherapeutic changes 
(Lanphier et al., 2015; Greely, 2019). Such uses will lead 
to new questions about breeding (eugenics) of the human 
species and its position in the universe (Yang, 2015). In 
one study, the fur color of rats was successfully changed by 
genome editing (Yoshimi et al., 2014). It is possible that the 
skin color of people could be changed in the future. Since 
the characteristics of individuals can be determined by 



AYANOĞLU et al. / Turk J Biol

genome editing rather than blood relations, the possibility 
that children with similar physical and mental health can 
be born in the same way should be considered (Ishi, 2015).

The second bioethical issue is what the fate of 
children born using genome editing will be. From whom 
or where informed consent will be obtained in the 
case of undesirable effects on behalf of genome-edited 
children and whether informed consent will give detailed 
information are important questions (Beriain and del 
Cano, 2018; Neuhaus and Zacharias, 2018; Sykora, 2018; 
Knoppers and Kleiderman, 2019). While clear informed 
consent can be given for genome-edited somatic cells to be 
used in clinical trials, it is an enigma to whom and how to 
give precise information about the potential risks involved 
in germline editing (Lanphier et al., 2015; Neuhaus and 
Zacharias, 2018; Knoppers and Kleiderman, 2019).

In December 2015, the International Summit on 
Human Gene Editing was convened to discuss the 
social, moral, and bioethical issues caused by genome 
editing in the human germline. The results of the summit 
concluded that basic and clinical investigations should 
be continued in accordance with the appropriate legal 
and ethical regulations; however, genome editing on 
gametocytes and embryos that would cause hereditary 
changes in humans was found to be irresponsible. It was 
therefore emphasized that the use of CRISPR-Cas9 on the 
human germline should be postponed until a solution is 
found for existing bioethical, social, legal, and technical 
concerns and issues (Baltimore et al., 2015). In addition, 
it was agreed to establish an international forum where 
such concerns could be addressed continuously and the 
studies in different countries could be organized together 
(Baltimore et al., 2015; Lanphier et al., 2015; Olson, 
2015). The NIH announced that genome editing studies 
in human embryos will not be financially supported 
(Collins, 2015). In spite of the joint decisions that were 
made, in February 2016, British scientists were allowed 
to use CRISPR-Cas9 and similar technologies in human 
embryos for research purposes only (https://www.bbc.
com/news/health-35459054). In March 2017, the US 
National Academy of Sciences and the American Society 
of Human Genetics published a position statement stating 
that they should be aware of the scientific and bioethical 
issues that can be caused by germline genome editing, but, 
on the other hand, research should continue (Ormond et 
al., 2017). As of January 2020, 24 countries have forbidden 
genome editing in human embryos by law and 9 countries 
have banned it by guidelines. However, there are countries 
that do not impose strict prohibitions on germline genome 
editing (Ishii, 2017b; Lau et al., 2018; Macintosh, 2019).

5. Discussion and future directions
Thanks to its high accuracy, ease of use, and relatively low 
cost, CRISPR-Cas9 offers a wide range of applications for 

many people in the medical, agricultural, livestock, and 
environmental sectors. Furthermore, its precision and 
accuracy are much higher compared to older technologies 
such as ZFN and TALEN (Mittal, 2019). The powerful 
effects of CRISPR-Cas9 have raised many social, moral, 
and bioethical issues. 

Discussions have generally focused on the social, 
bioethical, and legal consequences of using genome editing 
technology in human germline cells. Scientists generally 
agree that CRISPR-Cas9 should be allowed for use in the 
creation of human disease models, and in understanding 
the development and molecular mechanisms of diseases; 
however, it should be prohibited for the purposes of 
eugenics or enhancement. When ethical issues, safety 
concerns, and application difficulties are considered 
together, it is predicted that therapeutic genome editing 
in human embryos will not be possible in the near future. 
Thus, the risk of hereditary nontarget genetic mutation is 
higher than the possible treatment benefits and it affects the 
principle of intentional harm. Nevertheless, it is clear that 
scientists will apply CRISPR-Cas9 in germline cells in the 
future if solutions are found to the issues mentioned here 
(Duardo-Sánchez, 2017; Hirsch et al., 2019). CRISPR-Cas9 
must be fully reliable for therapeutic use in germline cells. 
Social, legal, and bioethical issues should be discussed in 
detail once genome editing technologies have reached the 
permissible level of safety for clinical applications in the 
prevention of genetic diseases (Rossant, 2018; Cathomen 
et al., 2019). Subsequently, regulatory laws that may 
eliminate breaches of germline genome editing will need 
to be reassessed (Rodriguez, 2016; Duardo-Sánchez, 2017; 
Cathomen et al., 2019; Macintosh, 2019). The therapeutic 
use of CRISPR-Cas9 and its rapid rise in the medical 
field are expected to continue. While studies on the use 
of CRISPR-Cas9 for clinical purposes are continuing, the 
necessary legal, social, and ethical legislation should be put 
into practice as soon as possible and the public conscience 
should not be ignored.

On the other hand, the potential effects of CRISPR-
Cas9 in other areas should not be forgotten. CRISPR-
Cas9 is not just about social and bioethical issues related 
to people. Interactions with other organisms and the 
environment, such as the consideration of the principle 
of intentional harm in risk assessment, safety measures to 
prevent ecological degradation, or potential use in genetic 
enhancement of animals and agriculture products should 
also be discussed (Rodriguez, 2016; Hirsch et al., 2019). 
There are serious concerns about changes in the natural 
ecosystem that may occur if the GMOs produced with 
CRISPR-Cas9 are released to the ecosystem in a controlled 
or uncontrolled manner. Considering the applications 
of CRISPR-Cas9 that protect mosquitoes from malaria 
parasites (Gantz et al., 2015) or make female mosquitoes 



AYANOĞLU et al. / Turk J Biol

117

infertile (Hammond et al., 2016), the effect of GM 
mosquitoes on other organisms with which they are 
associated in their ecosystems cannot be predicted. It is 
clear that small-scale research in the laboratory does not 
fully reflect possible changes in the natural ecosystem 
(Carroll, 2017). In agriculture, another concern about 
GMOs produced with CRISPR-Cas9 is whether they will 
be accepted by the public. GMOs that were produced 
using different technologies in the past faced harsh 
public reactions (Carroll, 2017). Furthermore, the fact 
that GMOs produced with CRISPR-Cas9 are difficult 
to identify outside the laboratory raises safety concerns 
(Shinwari et al., 2017). Before the launch of such products, 
the necessary explanations and declarations should be 
made by the authorities in a transparent and clear manner 
in order to prevent misjudgments and questions that may 
occur in the public, and precautions and arrangements 
should be established to ensure the safety of the public. 

Another issue to consider about CRISPR-Cas9 is 
patenting. Patenting can considerably limit the application 
of such technologies. Unilateral patenting can significantly 
increase the profitability of biotechnology companies, 
which may lead to a rise of bioethical issues. There is 
disagreement in the scientific community regarding the 
patenting or nonpatenting of GMOs to be used specifically 
for therapeutic purposes (Shinwari et al., 2017; Sherkow, 
2018). However, there are some who think that patenting 
will help to eliminate and regulate the deficiencies in the 

field (Rodriguez, 2016; Shinwari et al., 2017). It should 
not be forgotten that the most important of these debates 
about patenting is commercialization and the release of 
only reliable products.

In recent years, deals between the scientific community 
and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors for 
the therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 have raised public 
safety concerns (Shinwari et al., 2017; Carroll, 2019) The 
guidelines and legislations that will regulate the content 
and application of these deals should be prepared as 
quickly as possible and shared with the public. Due to 
the challenges and bioethical issues of CRISPR-Cas9, 
the scientific community and other interested bioethical, 
social, legal, and governmental parties should be provided 
with a detailed guide for future processing and use of 
this technology (Otieno, 2015; Shinwari et al., 2017; 
Cathomen et al., 2019). In this way, a long-term policy can 
be developed that will support the scientific development 
of CRISPR-Cas9 technology together with the discussion 
of the possible problems in advance and preparation of 
solution plans.
